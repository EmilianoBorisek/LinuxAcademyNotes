LPIC ESSENTIALS - SHELL SCRIPTING

LESSON: SHELL SCRIPTING PART1

Notes:

.sh extension: identifies script as it.
Are created with text editors

Parts:
#!/bin/bash: shebang, inform to bash what command interpreter use
# Comment: describes the purpose of the script. Allways begin with "#"
Environment $vars just need to be inserted with $.
Executable permissions should be run in the .sh file to run

To execute it:

absolute path where it's stored
relative: using ./ if we are in the current dir where .sh is
$PATH: will show where system will execute scripts if we add the script there
the pc will understand that should be executed.

Conditional statement:
Test the value of something, and depending on the output decide which action to take

if [test a condition]; then [results]
* the "then" could be in the same line or in different lines

eg: if ["1" == "1" ] 
> then
> echo "Yep, they're the same"
> fi (finish "IF" statement)

THIS should echo if the numbers are equal

##############################################################################

IF - ELSE statement


eg: current working directory is same from $HOME
if [ "$PWD" == (this compares) $HOME" ]
> then
      echo "You are home."
else
    echo "You are in $PWD"
fi

this should print: 1) You are at home if $PWD=$HOME
		   2) You are $PWD

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LESSON: SHELL SCRIPTING PART2

Notes:

for loops: perform the same action in each item in a set of values that we define
eg:

for i in john mary jack pedro (variable i, represent each name)
(i will be different in each case, using each of the names)

for i in john mary jack pedro
do
echo "$i"
done
THIS WILL PRINT ALL THE NAMES AVAILABlE FOR I

Range of numbers:
for i in {1..10}

do
echo "$i"
done
Will print all the numbers

############################################
Set up local variable: pathnames, etc is good to use vars if we need to change
the location of the script

For this add at the top:
VARNAME=VALUENEEDED
eg: DOCUMENTS="/home/documents"

using it: 
for doc in "$DOCUMENTS"/*.txt
this will show any *.txt in DOCUMENTS 
we can add "echo" to show in the screen

##########################################################

SKIP Portions of the script:
we can create vars like: VALUE=$1 reffering to the first action after the script execution.
For example: SHOWDAY=$1
	     this will take action, for eg, using if based on the first command user use with the script.


do to DO something
done to finish that
